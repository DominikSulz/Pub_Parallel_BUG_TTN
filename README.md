To run the examples one must add the folders "parallel_TTN_integrator" via the addpath(...) function from Matlab. Further, one must download and also add the tensor toolboxes "tensorlab", hm-toolbox and "tensortoolbox". Link to it can be found at:

Tensorlab: https://www.tensorlab.net/#download Tensortoolbox: https://www.tensortoolbox.org/ hm-toolbox: https://github.com/numpi/hm-toolbox

Further, also the folder "TTNO", which is an other repository (find here: https://github.com/DominikSulz/TTNO) has to be added. 

After including all folders, one can run the examples by running the scripts: run_script_long_range_Ising.m for the Ising model and runscript_error_plot.m for the error plot.
