To run the examples one must add the folders "parallel_TTN_integrator" via the addpath(...) function from Matlab. Further, one must download and also add the tensor toolboxes "tensorlab" and "tensortoolbox". Link to it can be found at:

Tensorlab: https://www.tensorlab.net/#download Tensortoolbox: https://www.tensortoolbox.org/

After including all folders, one can run the examples by running the scripts: run_script_long_range_Ising.m for the Ising model and runscript_error_plot.m for the error plot.
